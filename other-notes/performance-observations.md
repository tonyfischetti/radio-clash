# Performance Observations

As of, roughly, commit `cab953640b536ffb`, the free memory is 1354B
Bringing the total number of pixels down to 8 (from 16) yields 1386B
Meaning that each stick costs 32 bytes of memory.
Makes sense... 4 bytes per channel, 8 pixels in a stick
So I shouldn't have any _memory_ problems adding one more

Implemented timing the patterns' inner loops
These are the number of milliseconds

pattern 0: 9127
pattern 1: 2833
pattern 2: 1
pattern 3: 1

Now let's try that trick to increase the speed of `analogRead`...

pattern 0: 8858 (269 ms)
pattern 1: 2780 (53 ms)
pattern 2: 1
pattern 3: 1
I don't know if it's worth it. Are the analog reads unstable?

To improve performance, I made a macro called `DEBUG_VALUES()`
that either expands to `debug_values()` or `true` depending on
the value of `DEBUG`. I wanted to avoid the function call overhead
of calling `debug_values()` if DEBUG is false in a way that isn't
ugly. It made no difference whatsoever. I don't know how

Testing performance/memory differences between DEBUG true and false

Testing difference between using F and not using F

with
1300B

btw, times are pattern `all_color_change_pattern_1` with
step size of 1 and step delta of 2
THUS FAR

Hereafter, we'll use (the current) pattern 0 with step delay
and delta of 0 and 2, respectively

It looks like each stick of 8 uses 32 bytes
So 64 (8 neopixel sticks) would use 256



make _says_ 22298 B / 1239 B
but it's really 1103 B

(commit after 8fd17af70)
22080 B / 1253 B
