_Can I use two neopixel sticks with a power supply stick that
maxes out at 800 mA?_

What should be the highest current (pattern 2 / white) didn't blow a .5
amp fuse, so.... we good?

R estimated that it should be no more than 350 mA
ratios suggest 310

The datasheet says the typical current is 18.5

(assuming that means full brightness warm white)

so that tracks

18.5 * 8 * 2

# After building it with 3

As it turns out, light box will get sick if you use 3 sticks at full
brightness warm white :(

Anddddd... I—just now—realized it doesn't happen with some chargers

With 9V chargers—ranging from 1A to 3A, it wasn't long, at all,
before it started bugging out (I say that because I don't think
it's Light Box).

HOWEVER... it's been going on 15 min with a charger thats
5V 8A.

So it's either (a) the other chargers were lying about how many
amps they push, or (b) [more likely?] the
[power supply](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13032) I chose
(whose current limit is 800mA [and I have no reason not to believe
them]) didn't reach the current limit; it was bugging out because
it's regulating a 9V source down to 5V caused it to overheat

If that's true, a 7V charger (and at least 1A) should last
longer than the 9 volds. Maybe it won't even overheat at all!


I'm surprised it works with a 5V charger. I would think that there's
a voltage drop at the power supply's regulator.


It's been an hour. Still going strong!

Tested again with a 6V charger--never stopped working

I just added another stick and it looks like the it still
works. It must have been the heat from the 9V
