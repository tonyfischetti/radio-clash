  - make a macro for debugging (time, __FILE__, etc...)
  - Look at Makefile
    â€¢ -std=c++20
  - is it in stereo?
  - Use overloading instead of default parameters
  - implement IR control override
  - change analog reading settings
  - save things to EEPROM
  - dynamically change update times
  - Someone uses the folling code it ensure the right thing plays...
    ```
    void playTrack(uint8_t track) {
        player.stop();
        delay(200);
        player.play(track);
        delay(200);
        int file = player.readCurrentFileNumber();

        while (file != track) {
            player.play(track);
            delay(200);
            file = player.readCurrentFileNumber();
        }
    }
    ```

  - Does more grounding of SD hood (or connectors) help?
  - Try to use a 470uF across the power pins of the amplifier
    (or the "supply" pins)
  - Ask question (on forum) about combing audios into one (no transistor?)
